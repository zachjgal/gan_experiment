# My GAN adventure

This is my attempt at a GAN that can generate 
handwritten letters. I'm training it on the 
uppercase letters of the EMNIST balanced data set:

(You can also load it with torchvision)

This is a crappy way of forging real handwriting, but
you could use this to make a pretty cool ransom note.
